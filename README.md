### How I built it ###
I copied the main wordle from this tutorial: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-wordle-clone-in-javascript/

Then, I added customizable features:
* Number of attempts (3-10)
* Length of words (3-8)
* Gutter mode (on/off) which protects from beginner wordle mistakes

### To run app ###
Run `live-server build` in terminal in `worldleclone` directory
